protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy and a new social good


Description of ABIS protocol
============================

This concept begins with a description of what it is, what it is not, and what it could be.
First, the proposal here - a conceptual protocol to enable decentralization - is not new.  There are many such protocols.  At its essence, this proposal respects voluntaryist characteristics and ideas about free will inherent in many systems.

Basic level:
Suggests a mechanism to be adopted for any cryptocurrency that would alter the fee layer to help fund a new public good.
Just as this could be designed by developers for any decentralized cryptocurrency - bitcoin, litecoin, feathercoin, quarkcoin, and any of the many currencies that are blossoming - this could also be applied to any system which decentralizes the management of:
- widely used fiat currencies
- hourbank systems
- localized currency systems
- barter arrangements

Because this protocol would operate on a decentralized basis, there would be no one person who could decide what would be funded on the microtransaction level.  This would be determined differently by each person who is a user of a system employing this protocol.
This protocol could be deployed via wallet technology, for example.  

This proposal suggests that the ABIS protocol be implemented as part of each currency system - those in existence now and those that will come to be - dependent upon the will and ability of developers and users of currency systems to integrate the ABIS protocol into the system they are using and / or developing.

A user's option in any given cryptocurrency might look like this under the ABIS protocol:

*Optional transaction fee...*
*Pay transaction fee <user-selected amount> <currency unit selection>*
*Divide transaction fee <user-selected percentage> <label of destination> <address of destination>*
