protocol concept to enable decentralization and expansion of a giving economy and a new social good



This concept begins with a description of what it is, what it is not, and what it could be.
First, the proposal here - a conceptual protocol to enable decentralization - is not new.  There are many such protocols.  At its essence, this proposal respects voluntaryist characteristics and ideas about free will inherent in many systems.
